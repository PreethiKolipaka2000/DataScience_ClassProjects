font-family:"Cambria",serif'>The goal of analysing the Zomato dataset is to
gain a better understanding of the factors influencing the establishment of
various types of restaurants in various locations in Bengaluru, as well as the
aggregate rating of each restaurant. Bengaluru, for illustration, has over
12,000 restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With new restaurants
opening every day, the sector hasn't yet reached saturation, and demand is
growing by the day. Despite the rising demand, new restaurants are finding it
difficult to compete with established establishments. The majority of them
provide the same dishes. Bengaluru is known as India's IT capital.</span></b><span
